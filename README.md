Inbox Handoff ModuleInbox Handoff Module
🤖 Bot-to-Human Inbox Handoff Logic

✅ Module Overview
The Inbox Handoff module is a logic-based escalation layer built on top of the AI Smart Inbox (Messenger, Instagram DM, WhatsApp). It detects when AI responses are insufficient, sensitive, or repeatedly ignored, and automatically escalates to a human staff member. This ensures smooth transitions without losing conversation context or history.

🌟 Goals
Prevent customer frustration due to robotic replies
Route high-intent or unresolved queries to humans
Log every escalation with audit trail and timestamps
Let staff reply inside the same shared inbox view (or via assigned apps)
Enable hybrid bot-human conversation loops

🧪 Core Features
1. ✨ Smart Escalation Triggers
Rule-based triggers:
User repeats a question 2+ times
Keywords like “need help”, “speak to agent”, “wrong order”
Any negative sentiment detected via NLP
No AI reply sent within 15s
Confidence-score trigger:
If the AI reply confidence score is below a set threshold (e.g., 0.7)
Manual trigger:
Agent or admin can tag conversation to “Force Handoff”
2. 📢 Handoff Notification System
Staff Notification Options:
Email
WhatsApp internal group
Platform dashboard bell icon
Payload includes:
Customer name, message history (last 5)
Channel (Messenger / IG / WhatsApp)
Trigger reason
Time since message
3. 🛋️ Staff Assignment Engine
Modes:
Round-robin: among available agents
Priority routing: VIP customers go to senior agents
Manual override: Admin can assign specific inbox to someone
Staff View:
Web inbox module with:
Message view + reply
Customer profile (from mapping system)
AI reply suggestion (optional)
Mark as resolved / escalate further / tag
4. 🔒 Audit Logging
Logs every:
Trigger event
Escalation assignment
Staff replies and handback
Resolution timestamp
Stored in inbox_handoff_logs with:
message_id, trigger_type, assigned_to, response_time, channel, customer_id
5. ➡️ Rejoin Bot Flow
After human resolves:
Agent marks thread as “Resolved”
Bot auto-responds with follow-up: > “Glad our team could help! Let me know if you have more questions.”
Conversation returns to AI mode unless manually locked

🔄 Integration Flow
✉ Messenger/IG/WhatsApp webhook receives message
🤖 AI replies if confidence score ≥ 0.7
⚠️ Otherwise, checks escalation rules
⚖️ If triggered, logs event, sends handoff alert, assigns agent
📢 Agent notified, joins inbox, sees full thread
💬 Agent resolves, hands back to bot

Inbox Intelligence EngineInbox Intelligence Engine
Inbox Intelligence Engine – Technical Module Documentation

🧠 Overview
The Inbox Intelligence Engine is a core module designed to intelligently parse, identify, and map incoming customer conversations (in Messenger, Instagram DMs, and WhatsApp) to known customer identities, previous orders, and website accounts.
This engine supports personalization, order syncing, and real-time contextual replies — all by understanding who the user is based on their past history.

🎯 Core Goals
Identify users based on message content, name, phone, email, or order references.
Track past interaction history across platforms.
Link social media profiles to WooCommerce/Shopify customers.
Extract actionable data from conversations (e.g., complaints, interests, feedback).
Trigger workflows based on message content.

🔧 Technical Architecture
1. Message Collector Layer
Meta API Webhooks to collect:
Messenger thread messages
Instagram DM messages
Story replies, mentions, etc.
WhatsApp Business API (via provider like Twilio/360Dialog)
Standardized schema:
{
  "platform": "facebook_messenger",
  "message_id": "abc123",
  "sender_name": "Rafi",
  "sender_id": "fb:1000123",
  "text": "Hi, I placed an order #4523 but didn’t get a call",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-10T06:15:00Z"
}

2. Entity Extraction Engine
NLP Pipeline
Name detection (match to user database)
Phone/email regex match
Order reference pattern (e.g., #1234, Order ID 9911)
Sentiment & intent classifier: complaint, feedback, inquiry, product_request
Customer classifier confidence score
result = {
  "matched_customer_id": 4215,
  "confidence": 0.88,
  "intent": "complaint",
  "order_id": 9911,
  "matched_fields": ["phone", "name"]
}

3. Customer Mapping Graph
Build a Customer Identity Graph:
FB sender ID ↔ website customer ID
WhatsApp number ↔ previous order
Email from inbox ↔ user profile
Cross-links from CRM uploads
Data store: Neo4j or graph-based PostgreSQL table
Visual in Admin Panel for merged profiles

4. Inbox Enhancer UI
Sidebar Component
Shown inside unified Inbox UI:
Customer Name + Tier (Gold/Silver)
Location (from order history)
Past purchases
Tags (e.g., VIP, Regular, Refund Complainer)
Message insights (intent, sentiment)
Smart Reply Suggestions
GPT-generated replies based on past orders
Action button to:
Mark as complaint
Trigger re-delivery workflow
Send discount code

🔁 Workflow Example
Rafi sends DM: “My order 9911 didn’t arrive. Can I reorder or get help?”
Message ingested via webhook
NLP detects order ID, sentiment = complaint
Matched to WooCommerce Customer rafi.hossain@gmail.com
Sidebar shows past 3 orders, last refund history
GPT recommends reply: “Hi Rafi! I’m so sorry about your experience. Let me look into order 9911 and make this right. Can I offer you a free replacement or refund?”
Agent selects reply + triggers delivery retry

🧰 Tech Stack
Backend: Python (FastAPI)
NLP: spaCy + OpenAI + regex pipeline
Vector Store: FAISS for matching message context
Customer Store: PostgreSQL + Neo4j for mapping
Frontend: React (inbox plugin), connects to shared CRM

🔒 Privacy & Compliance
All messages encrypted in storage
GDPR-compliant consent + data usage log
Opt-out handling and masking for sensitive queries

🔑 Superadmin Controls

Inbox Ugc & Auto Reply ModuleInbox Ugc & Auto Reply Module
📨 Facebook Page Inbox Auto-Reply & UGC Inbox Mining Module

Overview
This module is the foundation for conversational AI inside the Facebook Page inbox. It allows brands like Lavishta to:
Respond to incoming DMs with smart replies using GPT.
Understand user intent (e.g., order status, product query, skincare help).
Log useful UGC content (e.g., “I love this toner!”, “Any solution for acne scars?”)
Tie inbox users to known customers (via previous orders, uploaded customer base, or CRM).
All this operates in one of 3 modes per brand: - ✅ Manual – staff reply manually, but system logs UGC and customer match. - 🧠 Assisted – AI drafts reply, human approves. - ⚙️ Auto – GPT replies automatically, logs everything.
How It Works
1. Webhook Connection to Page Inbox
Subscribe to messages, message_deliveries, message_reads, messaging_postbacks from Meta.
Store inbox messages in inbox_messages table with sender_id, message, timestamp, matched_customer_id, etc.
2. Intent Detection Pipeline
Use OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with system prompt: > “You are a skincare advisor for a Bangladeshi beauty brand. Classify the intent of this message.”
Output: intent (product_query, order_status, advice, complaint, general)
Save with each message.
3. UGC Mining Engine
Filter messages with positive tone or product experience.
Store in ugc_quotes table with fields:
message
product_match (via vector match)
sentiment
used_in_blog: boolean
4. GPT Reply Generator
Pre-fill reply based on intent + customer history:
“Hi [Name], thanks for loving our Niacinamide Serum! It works even better when paired with [Product]. Want the full routine?”
GPT uses:
Brand tone settings
Product vector database
UGC context
Replies returned with confidence score + editable field.
5. CRM Matching Logic
Match user by:
Phone/email collected from message
Prior comment records
Uploaded customer base
Update inbox_customer_map table with sender_id, customer_id, source, match_score
6. Personalization Rules per Brand
Brands can define via panel:
Reply tone: friendly, expert, short, detailed
Allowed GPT intents (e.g., auto-reply only for product_query)
Enable/disable logging of sensitive UGC
7. Admin Dashboard
Shows:
Inbox threads with filters (intent, tone, match)
GPT reply suggestions (approve/send/edit)
Stats: avg response time, UGC mined, automation %, match rate

User clicks “Connect Facebook Page” in their brand panel
Redirects to Meta OAuth URL with platform app ID
After user accepts permissions, Facebook redirects to /oauth/facebook/callback
SaaS backend exchanges code for access_token
Store token in brand_integrations with scope = pages_messaging, pages_read_engagement
Register Webhook with callback = https://platform/api/meta/webhook and brand context
Incoming webhooks now contain Page ID → map to brand_id

🔐 Security Controls:
AES256 encryption for tokens
Scoped access per brand
Tokens auto-refreshed via CRON every 12h
Superadmin can manually revoke or re-auth
All API calls to Meta/Google/Woo/etc are wrapped by a brand-aware proxy with rate limiters

🧑‍💼 Superadmin Controls:
Enable/Disable any integration per brand
View logs of connection attempts, token expiry, webhook failures
Re-auth token manually
Limit API usage per brand to avoid abuse

🚦 Error Handling:
Token expired → auto-refresh or show “Re-auth Required” warning
Invalid scope → show in brand panel with fix instruction
